    "The purpose of this lab is to implement an optimal algorithm & a user-friendly interface to play the game of Nim. This is an interesting challenge for 3 reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The game of Nim is a rare case of a strategy game, which is \"solved\" in the sense that if an optimal move exists, it can be always quickly computed, and if no optimal move exists, it can be quickly proven to be the case. This is unlike the games of Chess or Go, for which new algorithms constantly appear, all take a long time to compute, and none deliver provably optimal results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The optimal algorithm to play the game of Nim uses bitwise exclusive or, which is otherwise important in Software Engineering & Computer Science, and you'll have to know it in your further studies & in your future job.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. User interface needs to support several modes: player vs player, player vs computer, computer vs computer. There are interesting usability & user experience choices to be made in the final user-facing implementation of the game."

    "Most people when presented with a (very difficult) challenge of designing an algorithm to play Nim optimally follow a similar thought pattern (and quickly get stuck):\n",

    "- The player who begins has a winning strategy!\n",
    "- No, the player who goes second has a winning strategy!\n",
    "- Let's try all possible move combinations of some position X\n",
    "- But there is too many...\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that for any board position there are only two possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. No good move exists. If it's our turn to move and our opponent plays perfectly, whatever move we choose, we loose. These board positions are called \"N-positions\".\n",
    "2. There is a winning move, and if it's our turn to move our opponent is guaranteed to loose, unless we make a mistake. These board positions are called \"P-positions\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 important remarks about this statement:\n",
    "1. The fact that these are the only two options is not automatic. For example in chess, there is also a third option -- the draw. In go draws may or may not be possible depending on exact version of the rules being played (check out the \"superko\" rule and \"komidashi\"). What makes Nim different is that the number of elements on the board is finite to begin with and always decreasing (a pass or adding more elements isn't possible), which guarantees that one of the players will eventually remove the last element and win.\n",
    "2. The fact that one of the players has a winning strategy doesn't necessarily imply that the winning strategy is easy to discover or can be computed efficiently. In fact a stronger statement is true: for some games we know that the **first player** to move *has* a winning strategy, but we still have no idea *what* that strategy is. If you're curious how this can possibly work, check out the strategy-stealing argument due to John Nash. What makes Nim special is that we can quickly decide, given any board, whether it is in a \"N-position\" or in a \"P-position\". The rest is easy: we have to always leave the board in a \"N-position\" after our move."

    "\n",
    "But how?\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick is to compute the nim-sum of the current board, say `X`, and the bitwise exclusive-or of each row size and `X`. If the result is less than the row length, we record the index of that row as a \"good index\". It can be shown that our list of good indices will always be non-empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then pick any good row, say with `r` elements and reduce its size to `X ^ r`. This guarantees an N-position.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's only one minor caveat: we prefer to operate with moves of the form `(row, elements)`, which can be passed to the function `make_move` rather than directly manipulating the rows. Instead of reducing the row length to `X ^ r`, we can just return the difference of `X ^ r` and the row size as the number of elements to remove from the row.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if our board is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, the nim-sum of the board is `1` and the coressponding bitwise XOR of `1` and each element of the board is `[4, 5, 2, 3, 0]`. Doing an element-wise comparison we get $4 < 5$, $5 >= 4$, $2 < 3$, $3 >= 2,$ $0 < 1$. This means that only rows 1, 3 and 5 (with indices 0, 2, and 4) are \"good\", since $4 < 5$, $2 < 3$ and $0 < 1$ and any of the moves: `(1, 5 - 4) == (1, 1)`, `(3, 3 - 2) == (3, 1)` and `(5, 1 - 0) == (5, 1)` would be optimal, where `(1, 1)` for example means \"remove one element from first row\"."
